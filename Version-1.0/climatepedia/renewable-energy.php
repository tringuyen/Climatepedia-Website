<p>
Renewable energy comes from natural sources such as sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, water, and biofuels powered by feedstocks. These sources are considered “renewable” because they are naturally replenished in the normal flow of the world. Oil, coal, natural gas, and nuclear power are not renewable sources of energy.

Although renewable energy sources and consumption have been growing, renewable electricity excluding hydropower still accounts for a small percentage of total energy production and generation.

Increasing oil prices, climate change and global warming concerns, greater government support, and wider citizen support are propelling supportive legislation, which result in better economic incentives that make commercialization more feasible.

<h4>Alternative Energy v.s. Renewable Energy</h4>
<p>
Alternative energy and renewable energy are terms often interchanged in daily conversation, and indeed in meaning they are both viable in most situations. As mentioned earlier, renewable refers to any natural source that is naturally replenished, while alternative usually refers to any source other than the traditional fossil fuels. This becomes important when talking about nuclear energy, as it can be considered an alternative source of energy to fossil fuels, but many do not consider it renewable. The debate on this is addressed in the Nuclear Energy section below.
</p>

<a name="importance"></a>
<h4>Why Is It Important?</h4>

<a name="sustainability"></a>
<h5>Sustainability</h5>
<p>It is evident that eventually our sources of oil and coal will be depleted, at which point we’ll need to have already developed an infrastructure of energy production capable of supporting our world, or else we’re going to be in serious trouble. The actual time frame for that point is highly debated and has been revised many times over the years.</p>

<a name="security"></a>
<h5>Energy Security</h5>
<p>Producing energy within a nation’s own borders decreases dependence on others, increasing security in the event of a cutoff of supply.</p>

<a name="environment"></a>
<h5>Environment</h5>
<p>Burning fossil fuels increases the toxic particles in the air, speeding up anthropogenic climate change, or global warming.</p>

<a name="benefits"></a>
<h4>What Are The Benefits?</h4>

<a name="environmental"></a>
<h5>Environmental Benefits</h5>
<p>Renewable energy sources have a much lower environmental impact than conventional energy technologies. Sources such as fossil fuels contribute heavily to issues like smog, acid rain, and global warming.</p>

<a name="jobs"></a>
<h5>Jobs and Economy</h5>
<p>The majority of capital investment in renewable energy goes into the materials and labor to build and maintain the facilities, as compared to the large sums spent on importing another nation’s oil. In the United States renewable energy investments are frequently spent in the same state, and many times even in the same town. This means that the investment dollars are spent stimulating the local economy. Of course, oil companies also employ thousands of people, and are currently able to provide energy at a lower price than renewable sources because the infrastructure is stronger. While renewable energy projects invest more money into the local economy, oil results in lower energy costs for that local economy, so at present there’s a tradeoff to each side. Theoretically when the renewable energy infrastructure grows strong enough to support entire cities the difference in cost between oil and renewable sources like solar energy, wind energy, or biofuels will be negligible, making the choice economically rational and beneficial to all parties.</p>
<p>Some see the increase in a variety of fuel sources as a possible way to spur economic competitiveness in the energy market, which is at present largely controlled by OPEC – a conglomerate of oil producing nations.</p>

<a name="stability"></a>
<p>Some suggest that once a strong infrastructure for renewable energy production is in place then the supply of energy will be more stable than our current system. The reasons given for this are that the renewable energy grid would be</p>
<ol>
<li>Locally produced.</li>
<li>No dependency on one energy source.</li>
<li>The production area and the usage areas would be closer to each other, meaning less transportation of hazardous materials. Furthermore, the current system of large central power stations makes large areas vulnerable to failure in one station.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, some believe that the variable nature of the weather would make renewable energy less reliable.</p>

<a name="history"></a>
<h4>History of Renewable Energy</h4>
<p>Modern renewable energy technology can be recognized back to the second half of the 20th center, but the use of these energy sources is traceable back to the first time a human controlled a fire. Below is a timeline of some, though by no means all, significant events in the history of renewable energy. You’ll notice that the majority of the events concern wind power techniques, as prior to industrialization this was one of the primary forms of power.</p>

<h4>Economics of Renewable Energy</h4>
<p>
Capital investment in renewable energy theoretically follows the principle of economies of scale, in that average costs will decrease as production volume increases. This is to say that the more renewable energy that is produced, the lower the cost per unit of that energy is.
</p>
<p>
However, most renewable energy projects – particularly solar energy, wind energy, and geothermal energy, require very high up front capital investments, deterring many investors. Once this initial investment has been made though, materials are generally free. Thus the only costs associated with renewable energy production are maintenance, labor, and regulatory fees.
</p>
<p>
Aside from fears about global warming, <img src="css/images/pedia/solar.jpg" align="left" width="320" height="320" class="wrapleft" alt="solar energy is a great renewable energy source"> the primary driver behind investment in renewable energy is increasing oil costs. As oil becomes more expensive, renewable energy sources become more attractive. For example, take this statistic: “the cumulative capacity-weighted average price of wind power, including the production tax credit, was about 4.4 cents per kilowatt hour in 2009 – a price that competes with fossil fuel-generated electricity.” [1]
</p>
<p>
Many people also point to the renewable energy industry as being a young, innovative market, while the fossil fuels industry is very mature.
</p>
<p>
The industry is particularly suited for developing markets, as production and distribution of fossil fuels can be too expensive in countries without a suitable infrastructure. Furthermore, renewable energy projects in many developing countries have helped lessen poverty, as they provide the energy that businesses need to operate, thus increasing employment.
</p>

<a name="debate"></a>
<h4>Renewable Energy Debate/ Criticisms</h4>
<p>
One of the largest criticisms of renewable energy is that the supply of it is variable and intermittent. However, reliability increases quickly as a stronger foundation is laid. When the sun is covered by clouds in stormy conditions then theoretically the wind generators would be able to collect more energy. Conversely, when it’s a calm sunny day the solar collectors will be generating the majority of the energy. The key behind renewable energy sources is diversification, which will ultimately create a more reliable grid than the one driven by crude oil that we have now.
</p>
<p>
Solar and wind farms have been criticized further on the grounds that neither are aesthetically pleasing, considering that both take up large tracts of land.
</p>
<p>
Biomass and biofuels have been criticized for requiring large amounts of land to harvest the energy. However, the crops used as feedstock for biomass and fuels are also extremely biodiverse and replenish the fertility of the lands, which may be a better alternative when compared to vast strip mines and slag mountains used for coal harvesting.
</p>
<p>
Hydroelectric systems have been criticized for dislocating people who live where the reservoirs are planned, releasing significant amounts of CO2 at construction and flooding the reservoir, disrupting aquatic ecosystems and birdlife, adversely impacting the river environment, creating a risk of sabotage and terrorism, and the very unlikely possibility of catastrophic failure of the dam wall.
</p>
<p>
Some critics of wind farms have cited bird collisions as a drawback, as well as the aforementioned aesthetic concern.
</p>
<p>
Some point out that geothermal energy may not be strictly renewable, as it depends on the rate of extraction not being fast enough to deplete the source. However, if it were depleted it would regenerate over a long period of time.
</p>
<p>
A criticism of the renewable energy industry as a whole is that while the sources may be infinite, the infrastructure is not and will need to be replaced.
</p>

<a name="nuclear"></a>
<h4>Why is Nuclear Power Not Renewable?</h4>
<p>
The current types of nuclear power plants use uranium235 as fuel, of which there is a limited amount on earth. Some have suggested creating “breeder” reactors to create viable alternative fuels, but current safety concerns make this unfeasible. Nuclear fusion has long been the goal for the nuclear power industry, which would open up a source of power as infinite as the sun’s output (that is, in the order of billions of years of supply).

<h4>Statistics</h4>
<p>
The following are interesting statistics about renewable energy that have been pulled from the 2009 Renewable Energy Data Book published in August 2010 by the U.S. Department of Energy. It was produced by Rachel Gelman, edited by Michelle Kubik, and designed by Stacy Buchanan of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The original report
also has a full host of fascinating graphs and tables that we strongly recommend you look at.
</p>

<ul class="list">

<li>Renewable energy accounts for 21% of all global electricity generation when including hydropower, but only 3.8% without hydropower.</li>

<li>Solar PV and wind are the quickest expanding areas of renewable energy. In 2009 92% of renewable energy capacity during the year was in the form of wind energy (when excluding hydropower).</li>

<li>In contrast, the amount of electricity generated from hydropower, biomass, and geothermal sources have remained relatively constant since 2000.</li>

<li>Renewable energy capacity in both the world and in the United States has more than tripled between 2000 and 2009.</li>

<li>Renewable energy represents nearly 12% of total installed capacity and more than 10% of total generation in the United States in 2009.</li>

<li>In 2009, cumulative wind capacity increased by 29% and cumulative solar PV capacity grew nearly 52%.</li>

<li>Between 2000 and 2009, wind energy generation worldwide increased by a factor of almost 9.</li>

<li>In 2009 renewable energy accounted for more than 55% of all new electrical capacity installations in the U.S. – a large contrast from 2004 when all renewable energy captured only 2% of new capacity additions.</li>

<li>(In the U.S.) Between 2000 and 2009, production of corn ethanol increased by a factor of 6, and biodiesel production increased by a factor of more than 100.</li>

<li>Use of ethanol in the United States has also grown substantially, and it accounts for 7.8% of the total U.S. gasoline pool, up from 1% in 2000.</li>

<li>U.S. Energy Production in 2009: Coal – 29.7%, Nuclear – 11.3%, Hydropower – 3.6%, Non-Hydro Renewables – 7.0%, Crude Oil – 15.3%, Natural Gas – 33.0%.</li>
