			<h2> About </h2>

			<h3> Our mission </h3>
			<HR/>
			<p>Climatepedia&apos;s mission is to provide a reliable source of climate change information by connecting the public with academic research and perspectives.</p>

			<br/>

			<h3> More facts </h3>
			<HR/>
			<p>Climatepedia is a UCLA student-led initiative dedicated to <b><i>spread awareness about</i></b> climate change. Since its inception in 2010, the site has received support from the UCLA Center for Climate Change Solutions and over 100 signatories nationwide, as well as financial backing from UCLA&apos;s Green Initiative Fund. The funding covers website hosting fees and marketing materials. As such, the website does not generate profit for any faculty or students involved.</p>

			<p>We created this site because climate change is often misunderstood by the public. As students, we have learned to dispel myths that are perpetuated by popular websites and media coverage. University lectures and discussions often conflict with these misconceptions. Despite ample research that proves otherwise, many government leaders have erroneously labeled climate change a hoax. While uncertainties do exist, the question is not whether anthropogenic warming is occurring but to what extent. Climatepedia is our endeavor to bridge the gap between academic research and public knowledge about climate change.</p>

			<h2> How to contribute </h2>

			<h3> What makes Climatepedia unique? </h3>
			<HR/>
			<p>Climate change is widely misunderstood by many government leaders and citizens. We believe the confusion primarily stems from the complex, interdisciplinary nature of climate change and the misrepresentation of facts by certain groups and individuals. </p>

			<p>Academic and public views about climate change diverge greatly when comparing university lectures with mainstream websites, media coverage, and political leaders. Climatepedia will make climate information more accessible and transparent.</p>

			<p>As a result of conflicting information available to the public, little progress has been made toward a comprehensive legislative solution. Therefore, we hope to educate readers about current  academic climate change research to supplement the widely publicized information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>

			 <p>Organizations like RealClimate and NASA convey the complexity of academic climate research, but the material is not easily understood by the public. Climatepedia is a comprehensive source of information to fill this void.</p>

			<h3> How would I contribute? </h3>
			<HR/>
			<p>Our primary project is to oversee the development and publication of a petition in which professors, researchers, and graduate students can sign onto the following statement: </p>

			<Blockquote><p><i>"There is overwhelming scientific evidence that humans are causing Earth&apos;s climate to warm beyond natural variability. This is almost universally accepted by climate scientists and is also the basis for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international effort to provide up-to-date reports on the current state of climate research.</p> 

			<p>To minimize the consequences of human-induced climate change (e.g. more extreme droughts, heat waves, and flooding), we must reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and curb our carbon dioxide emissions."</i></p></Blockquote>

			<p>Signatories can also elaborate on the statement in posts listed on our <a href="#pp">Professor&apos;s Podium</a>.</p>

			<p>Furthermore, signatories can contribute to Climatepedia by developing terms in our <a href="#wsd">Wikipedia-style database</a>.</p>

			<p> We need your help to link the public with research and dispel climate change myths. </p>

			<p> Contact us at climate411@ucla.edu for more information on how to get involved. </p>
