<h5>What is a Magnetosphere?</h5>
<p>
The magnetosphere is the area around a planet in which that planet’s magnetic force is the dominant pressure. It is actually shaped by the solar wind, or the flow of ionized plasma constantly emitted from the Sun, and is what protects life on Earth from most of the harmful effects of solar activity. Other planets that have intrinsic magnetic fields also have magnetospheres.
</p>

<a name="importance"></a>
<h4>Importance and Effect of the Earth's Magnetosphere</h4>
<p>
The magnetosphere has allowed for life to flourish on Earth, as without it the supersonic, extremely hot, solar wind would constantly be blasting into the surface of the Earth. It also protects us from the brunt of most other solar activity, like coronal mass ejections (CME) or solar flares. Even with the magnetosphere though, large CMEs or solar flares can be extremely damaging to equipment on the Earth’s surface, not to mention in orbit. For example, in the largest geomagnetic storm ever recorded, the Carrington Event of 1859, a CME caused by a solar flare caused telegraph systems across North America and Europe to fail. If an event of this magnitude happened today the damage to electrical equipment would be disastrous. 
</p>

<a name="structure"></a>
<h4>Structure</h4>
<p>
The structure of the magnetosphere is determined by the flow of the solar wind and the electric currents that run inside of it. Broadly, it is compressed on the sunward side by the solar wind’s dynamic pressure, and is swept back on the night side by the solar wind flowing past the Earth. The composition of different areas within the magnetosphere depends on the movement of plasma as it interacts with various electric, magnetic, and dynamic forces. Each of the major sections of the magnetosphere is discussed below, and you can view the diagram halfway through the section for a visual representation of them.
</p>

<a name="bow"></a>
<h5>Bow Shock</h5>
<p>
The bow shock is the point at which the Sun’s supersonic solar wind flow is forced to slow down before it hits the magnetosphere. The physics behind this process is similar to sonic booms that jets when they exceed the sound speed of the medium they’re travelling in (air). The bow shock changes distance from the Earth depending on the strength of the solar wind flow. As plasma crosses the bow shock its density, temperature, and magnetic field increase, while its velocity decreases.
</p>

<a name="sheath"></a>
<h5>Magnetosheath</h5>
<p>
The magnetosheath is the region between the bow shock and the magnetopause, and contains compressed and heated solar wind plasma.
</p>

<a name="pause"></a>
<h5>Magnetopause</h5>
<p>
The magnetopause is the boundary at which the magnetosphere ends on the sun-ward side of the Earth, and where the solar wind actually interacts with the magnetosphere’s magnetic pressure. Most of the solar wind particles that hit the magnetopause are deflected and swept back into the magnetotail, while the ones that penetrate become part of the energetic Van Allen radiation belts.
</p>

<a name="tail"></a>
<h5>Magnetotail</h5>
<p>
The magnetotail is the area on the night side of the Earth where the solar wind carries the magnetosphere a long distance back into space (upwards of 3,000 Earth radii). This area acts as a reservoir for plasma and energy, which is released into the inner magnetosphere at various intervals during magnetospheric substorms.
</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Equatorial Current Sheet</strong>: This separates the magnetotail into two regions called the lobes, and flows from dawn to dusk.</li>
<li><strong>Lobes</strong>: The magnetic field in the north (south) lobe is directed away form (toward) the Earth. Plasma density is very low in this area.</li>
<li><strong>Plasmasheet</strong>: The plasma sheet is found between the lobes in the magnetotail, and contains extremely hot ions and electrons (estimated around 3keV and 1keV respectively).</li>
</ul>

</div>

<a name="plasma"></a>
<h5>Plasmasphere</h5>
<p>
The plasmasphere is the area around the Earth where cold plasma co-rotates with the Earth due to being dominated by the geomagnetic field. It is located above the ionosphere, and its outer boundary is the plasmapause.
</p>

<a name="van"></a>
<h5>Van Allen Radiation Belt</h5>
<p>
The Van Allen radiation belts consist of energetic particles on trapped orbits, and there are both electron and proton radiation belts. The energetic particles come from cosmic rays and are kept in orbit by Earth’s magnetic field. The radiation belts are particularly dangerous for space missions beyond low earth orbit, as the spacecraft and/or astronauts must cross through the Van Allen radiation belts, and are thus subject to Van Allen particle radiation. The radiation in this area from the energetic particles, solar flares, and cosmic rays are particularly damaging to electrical equipment on satellites, and usually needs to be shielded against.
</p>

<a name="ring"></a>
<h5>Ring Current</h5>
<p>
The ring current is the area in which large amounts of energy are placed during magnetic storms. By measuring the Ring Current with the disturbance storm time (Dst) index, we can measure the strength of a magnetic storm.
</p>

<a name="reconnection"></a>
<h4>Reconnection</h4>
<p>
Reconnection is one of the most fascinating discoveries of modern science, and has been suggested to be one of the primary means by which massive amounts of energy are transferred in our universe (on the scale of the energy transferred between the Sun and planets). To narrow it down to the scope of this article, reconnection is thought to drive magnetospheric flows and the dynamics of the solar corona.
</p>
<p>
When a magnetized plasma parcel (a flux tube) with one polarity is brought up to a magnetized plasma parcel with the opposite polarity, magnetic reconnection is thought to occur. At this point field lines connect and change their connectedness (topologies). This process of reconnection allows previously unconnected regions to exchange plasma, and hence mass, energy and momentum. This allows solar wind energy to be directly coupled with and channeled into the magnetosphere.
</p>
<p>
The first point of reconnection in the Earth-Sun system occurs at the magnetopause, where the solar wind (carrying the interplanetary magnetic field – IMF), interacts with the Earth’s magnetic field. The Earth always has a northward topology due to its dipole configuration, but the solar wind switches between southward and northward, and so this reconnection only happens when the solar wind has a southward component (opposite of the Earth’s).
</p>
<p>
A second reconnection point occurs in the magnetotail at the neutral point, which allows plasma to flow from the magnetospheric currents back into the solar wind and away from the Earth, re-establishing equilibrium of the system.
</p>

<a name="earth"></a>
<h4>Characteristics of the Earth's Magnetic Field</h4>
<p>
The Earth’s intrinsic magnetic field is most likely caused by electric currents in its liquid core, and sustained by the interaction between these electric currents and the existing magnetic field, which is described in the Dynamo Theory. The magnetic field takes on a dipole shape, where magnetic lines of force point out of the South Pole and back into the North Pole.
</p>

<a name="sun"></a>
<h4>Magnetosphere Interaction with the Sun</h4>
<p>
The magnetosphere is the primary point of connection between the Sun and the Earth, and is what drives most space weather events. The solar wind that is constantly ejected from the Sun at a supersonic speed consists of charged ions, which carry the Sun’s interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) out into space with the solar wind flow. 
</p>
<p>
A shock wave called the bow shock is created on the side where the solar wind plasma collides with the magnetosphere, as the solar wind is supersonic and the magnetosphere acts as an obstacle to its flow. This shock is similar in concept to a sonic boom. In this way the solar wind is directly responsible for shaping the magnetosphere, as a stronger solar wind will push the magnetopause back, and a weak solar wind will allow the magnetopause to grow. This pressure of balances is essentially found by balancing the solar wind’s dynamic pressure with the magnetosphere’s magnetic pressure.
</p>
<p>
This interaction results in a magnetospheric<img src="css/images/pedia/solarwind.jpg" alt="the sun's solar wind interaction with the earth's magnetic field and magnetosphere" width="350" height="255" class="wrapright" align="right"> cavity that has a long tail consisting of two antiparallel bundles of magnetic field (the magnetotail) that stretch in the antisolar direction for an unknown distance, though it has been estimated to be greater than 3,000 Earth radii.
</p>
<p>
When the IMF and Earth’s magnetic field connect it results in the transfer of energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere, and by extension from the Sun’s atmosphere to the Earth’s atmosphere. As described above, this energy is transferred in a process called reconnection, which occurs primarily at the point where a solar wind stream with a southward magnetic flux meets the Earth’s magnetosphere, which has a northward magnetic field at that point. Upon connecting, ionized plasma flows into the Earth’s magnetic currents and can build up at certain points – ultimately causing sub storms and magnetic storms. A second primary reconnection point on the dark side of the Earth reverses the flow of ionized plasma, returning it into the solar wind to flow past the Earth.
</p>
<p>
The Earth’s dipole moment is also tilted with respect to the axis, which means that the magnetic North Pole is not actually directly aligned with the geographic North Pole, and same for the South Pole. It is also constantly moving, so each time it has been measured it was further northwestward from its last measured location.
</p>

<a name="climate"></a>
<h4>Magnetosphere Interaction with the Earth's Climate</h4>
<p>
This part of the magnetosphere’s function is one of the least explored, and is being researched by today’s scientists.
</p>
<p>
At this point most believe that energy transferred from the solar wind through to the lower levels of the Earth’s atmosphere have only a minor affect on the climate, though very little research has been done to deny or confirm this belief.
</p>
<p>
While changing electric fields in the atmosphere can have catastrophic effects on our equipment both on the ground and in the air, it looks like global warming is most likely not linked to the magnetosphere.
</p>

<a name="aurora"></a>
<h4>Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights)</h4>
<p>
Aurora Borealis, or the Northern Lights, are an event that occurs when photons in the Earth’s upper atmosphere are excited (ionized). The ionization occurs when solar wind plasma has been injected into the Earth’s magnetosphere and been carried down magnetic field lines into the Earth’s upper atmosphere. Large auroral disturbances occur during magnetic storms, when huge amounts of energy course through the magnetosphere.

</div>

<a name="space"></a>
<h4>Space Weather and the Magnetosphere</h4>
<p>
Space weather is the interaction of the solar wind and solar events with the Earth, and is a huge concern for people both in space and on the ground. Solar events can not only damage sensitive spacecraft that power our GPS systems, television networks, credit card networks, etc., and harm astronauts in space, but they can also induce electric fields on the surface of the Earth – burning out electrical components in large pipelines like those used to transport oil or electricity.
</p>

<h5>Substorms</h5>
<p>
Substorms occur when the solar wind’s interplanetary magnetic field points southward for a brief time (30-60 mins), allowing for reconnection to occur. Many different hypotheses about substorms have been suggested, and we chose a common one to detail the events. Substorms start with a growth phase, during which energy extracted from the solar wind is stored in the magnetosphere. The next phase is the expansion phase, during which this stored energy is released and unloaded. Finally, the recovery phase returns the system to normal.
</p>

<h5>Magnetic Storms</h5>
<p>
Magnetic storms are large, prolonged disturbances of the magnetosphere caused by variations in the solar wind, and many follow coronal mass ejections or are caused by high speed streams of the solar wind. Furthermore, magnetic storms occur on a global scale, whereas substorms are more local to the magnetotail.
</p>
<p>
In one suggested train of events, magnetic storms begin with a phase called sudden commencement, during which a pressure increase from an interplanetary disturbance compresses the magnetosphere. The main phase of the magnetic storm occurs when the southward component of the IMF causes magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause, which increases ring current injection with energetic solar wind plasma. The recovery phase is last, and occurs as the southward IMF component weakens, slowing the reconnection rate, and reducing the injection of particles into the ring current.

<a name="other"></a>
<h4>Other Planets' Magnetospheres</h4>
<p>Scientists have been able to observe the magnetic activity surrounding most of the planets in our solar system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mercury</strong> – Mercury has a magnetosphere, but it is incredibly small compared to the rest of the solar system’s.</li>
<li><strong>Venus</strong> – Earth’s sister planet, Venus, does not have a magnetosphere in the same sense as the Earth and some of the other planets. This is because its magnetic field is not intrinsic, but is induced by the solar wind, and thus has no interaction with the solar wind.</li>
<li><strong>Mars</strong> – Mars does not have a magnetosphere, but is comparable to Venus in that its magnetic field is induced.</li>
<li><strong>Jupiter</strong> – Jupiter does have a magnetosphere, and it is the largest of all the planets. Jupiter’s moon Ganymede also has a magnetosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Saturn</strong> – Saturn does have a magnetosphere, and it is unique in that it is not tilted in respect to its axis.</li>
<li><strong>Uranus</strong> – Uranus does have a magnetosphere, and it is very similar to the Earth’s.</li>
<li><strong>Neptune</strong> – Neptune does have a magnetosphere, and it too is very similar to the Earth’s.</li>
<li><strong>Pluto</strong> – Is no longer considered a planet, so it doesn’t belong in this list and you’ll be left wondering whether or not it has a magnetosphere. Just kidding, we actually don’t know if Pluto has a magnetosphere or not. Furthermore, the probe that was sent out past Pluto to take measurements (New Horizons) does not have a magnetometer, so we won’t know any time soon either.</li>
</ul>
