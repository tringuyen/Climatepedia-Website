<a name="overview"></a>

<p>A climatologist is an atmospheric scientist who studies weather conditions over a period of time, not to be confused with a meteorologist. While meteorologists predict weather phenomena and patterns in the relative short-term, climatologists study climate trending over months, years, or centuries. However, much of the foundational education is the same and later specialization differentiates the two paths. A career in climatology could take you from the warm waters of South America to the sub-zero tundra of the poles.</p>
<p>Observance of the weather has existed as an occupation for as long as humanity itself, though it certainly has taken a more scientific turn lately when compared with the mystic sages of ancient societies. Today essentially every aspect of our day-to-day life is impacted by changing conditions, and it&#39;s a climatologist&#39;s job to look at the big picture of our world and the way we are interacting with our Earth. What happens in this big picture affects the plants that can grow in different areas, food production, survival of endangered species, air-pollution control, a population&#39;s energy usage, life expectancy, and ultimately some suggest even the long-term survival of our own species &#40;though this is highly debated, and this article does not take a stance on it&#41;.</p>
<p>A Climatologist gathers climate data and information, investigates climate signs, and analyzes these sources in order to make predictions about climate patterns. As any other data-centric field with many variables, a climatologist will use computer models extensively, specifically to study how the Earth&#39;s climate changes over time. In regards to anthropogenic global warming, climatologists will conduct research to analyze human&#39;s impact on Earth&#39;s current and future climate. Some Climatologists also study the climates of other nearby planets.</p>

<a name="profession"></a>
<h5>Climatology as a Profession</h5>

<p>
	Climatology looks at the trend of the entire Earth over thousands of years, so valuable data can come from any area. Paleoclimatology is the specific field that focuses on ancient weather patterns.
</p>
<p>
	Climatologists will look at ocean water temperatures, ocean current changes, glacial ice cores, cloud cover, lake sediments, tree rings, atmospheric conditions, solar conditions, etc., as well as less obvious sources such as plant or animal migrations or living habits. For example, if a certain plant has migrated either towards the polar caps or higher in altitude, it may be a sign to climatologists that their normal habitat has been warming. 
</p>
<p>
	Climatologists will monitor atmospheric conditions and cloud cover like meteorologists, but also pull data from a variety of other less obvious sources. For example, climatologists can study ocean temperatures and currents, which have a correlation with long-term climate conditions. They can also study mud from ancient lakes and ice cores from the poles to find evidence of sediments and other compounds which have been caught and preserved. By doing so they may see what climate conditions were like far in the past.
</p>
<p>
	Climatologists have to consider every angle of the story though, as the Earth is an amazingly complex system, so they may draw from more unexpected sources. As an example, a researcher may gather and pour through many landscape paintings and old texts or stories from previous societies in order to ascertain typical cloud cover, environmental events, and whether any indicator plant species existed in that area.
</p>
<p>
	In relation to anthropogenic climate change, or global warming, you will most likely study the effect of both man-made and naturally occurring greenhouse particles on the climate. Climatologists are the scientists who do their best to predict the effect we&#39;re having on our Earth, and the long-term trend. They then advice policy makers on the best path to take.
</p>

<h5>Interviews with Prominent Climatologists</h5>
<p>
We are currently conducting interviews with our network of Climatologist researchers and professors, check back soon to see the ones we post!
</p>

<a name="education"></a>
<h4>Education</h4>

<p>Education is very important, and this section needs to be completed.</p>

<a name="highschool"></a>
<h5>High School</h5>
<p>
	If you&#39;re aiming for a career in climatology you should choose physical science and advanced mathematics courses when you have the opportunity, as well as develop your computer skills and ability to write clearly and effectively. Beyond this just do your absolute best in all of your classes to give yourself the most choices when it comes time to find a college that fits you well.
</p>

<a name="bachelors"></a>
<h5>Undergraduate Study (Bachelor&#39;s Degree)</h5>
<p>
	The minimum requirement for any climatologist position is usually a bachelor&#39;s degree in climatology, meteorology, or another atmospheric science, though many may come from closely related fields. If you do choose a related field (see below), and you want to go on to graduate school, you may need to take extra classes to ensure you have the necessary core meteorology knowledge.
</p>
<p>
	For example, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics states that the desired educational background for entry-level atmospheric scientists in the Federal Government is a bachelor&#39;s degree and at minimum 24 term hours of meteorology or atmospheric science courses, as well as:
</p>

<ul>
<em> 9 term hours in:</em>
<li>
	subjects like computer science, statistics, chemistry, oceanography, climatology, hydrology, aeronomy, light and optics, electricity and magnetism, etc.
</li>
<em>6 term hours in:</em>
<li>
	analysis and prediction of weather systems
</li>
<li>
	atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics
</li>
<li>
	college physics
</li>
<em>3 term hours in:</em>
<li>
	physical meteorology
</li>
<li>
	ordinary differential equations
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<em>Fundamental School Subjects:</em> A lot of Math (algebra, trigonometry, calculus), Geography, Statistics, Computer Science, Physics, Meteorology, Agriculture.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Special School Subjects:</em> If you know what area you want to specialize in climatology you should take courses that will be relevant to your choice. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	Climatologists who want to work as consultants for businesses would do well to take business, economics, and statistics courses
</li>
<li>
	Those who wish to work for a publication or news station would benefit from journalism, English, or rhetoric classes.
</li>
<li>
	If you want to work as a climatologist in air quality control for the government, you could take extra courses in chemistry and political science.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<em>Related Undergraduate Majors:</em> Mathematics, physics, engineering, Geophysics, Environmental Science, Environmental Engineering, Geography, Hydrology, Geotechnical an Geoenvironmental Engineering,, Earth-Environmental Systems (EES).
</p>

<a name="masters"></a>
<h5>Graduate Study (Master&#39;s Degree):</h5>
<p>
	A master&#39;s degree will be necessary for some climatologist positions, and varies widely depending on the function of the job.
</p>

<a name="phd"></a>
<h5>Doctoral Study (Ph.D. Degree)</h5>

<p>
	A Ph.D. degree is usually necessary for a basic climatologist research position at a university, though not for work in the Federal Government.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Possible Subjects of Study:</em> Earth system science fields: climatology, ecology, biophysical or biogeochemical processes, environmental or agricultural science.
</p>

<a name="universities"></a>
<h5>Universities</h5>
	
<p>
	When picking a university make sure it offers courses that will be required by future employers, particularly ones like the National Weather Service. About 100 universities are approved by the American Meteorological Society, and below is a small sampling of all of the great colleges that offer majors that are applicable to becoming a climatologist. You can do further research at the <a href="http://www.ametsoc.org/amsucar_curricula/index.cfm">American Meteorological Society&#39;s page</a> that lists all of the approved colleges and universities.

<a name="preparation"></a>
<h4>Employment Preparation</h4>

<a name="experience"></a>
<h5>Getting Experience and Volunteering as a Climatologist</h5>

<p>
	Volunteer! On the path to becoming a climatologist this is one of the best ways to first get your foot in the door, and shows that you have the initiative and passion to get out there yourself and learn. Here are some positions that may be interesting, and many more are available at your local weather stations. [1]
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	Nearly every state has its own weather administration and are all eager for volunteers that have an interest in becoming a climatologist.
</li>
<li>
	As a storm spotter for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
</li>
<li>
	As a Daily Weather Observer with the Cooperative Observer Program (COOP).
</li>
<li>
	If you’re a seafaring individual, then as a Ship Weather Observer with the NOAA.
</li>
<li>
	As a Volunteer Weather Spotter with the National Weather Service.
</li>
<li>
	As a volunteer at the Weather Volunteer Observers Network of the National Hurricane Center (ON-NHC).
</li>
<li>
	Set up a local weather station and provide information to your local radio station with a daily report - an amateur climatologist!
</li>
<li>
	Get experience at the local airport, television or radio station as a weather data compiler or weather statistics researcher.
</li>
<li>
	Learn to read and interpret the various types of weather maps, charts, and data available to climatologists.
</li>
<li>
	Learn how to use database software. Many databases operate on the same type of architecture and have similar commands, but it would be wise to contact a climatologist at a local university and see what database software they use.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="internships"></a>
<h5>Climatologist Internships</h5>

<p>Internships are one of, if not the, best way to get experience in the Climatology field of work before graduating from college, and the same is true of nearly any industry. Your best bet is to find the climate organization that is closest to you and see if they either offer an intern/ co-op program, or may be willing to take you on as a volunteer.

For example, the Climate Institute offers internships for future climatologists in its Washington, DC-based headquarters.</p>

<a name="qualities"></a>
<h5>Desired Qualities</h5>

<p>
	<em>"Hard Qualities":</em>These are qualities you have developed through training or experience that can most likely be supported by empirical evidence from previous positions. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
	Previous research in specific relevant topics
</li>
<li>
	Experience with computer modeling
</li>
<li>
	A strong background in mathematics
</li>
<li>
	Computer Science courses
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<em>"Soft Qualities":</em>These are qualities you have developed over the long-term and are best supported with situational recounts. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	Strong oral and written communication skills.
</li>
<li>
	Ability to work effectively in teams, as you may often find yourself working in an interdisciplinary collection of ecologists, climatologists, industrial ecologists, economists, agricultural scientists, land surface scientists, etc.
</li>
<li>
	A passion for the field! Many people will often get wrapped up in making sure they qualify in every other way that they end up too nervous and forget to show their love for what they do. This is backwards though, as you should first demonstrate your passion for your work, and then support it with evidence showing that not only are you an engaged employee but you’re also effective and would be a great climatologist!
</li>
</ul>
<a name="tips"></a>
<h5>Application Tips</h5>

<p>
	As with any other professional position, to get a climatologist position you’ll almost certainly need to provide a current curriculum vitae/ resume, and should have the contact information of several professional references ready.

<a name="employment"></a>
<h4>Employment</h4>

<p>
	Climatology is a broad field with plenty of room for specialization, and you may end up working for various governments or a private enterprise. Many climatologists will work as weather station supervisors, computer programmers, or consultants for clients who need specific information because they are involved in activities like construction, forestry, commodity investments, defense, transportation, insurance, utilities, or agricultural business. Finally, many climatology researchers hold positions at universities and teach courses while delving deeper into their field.

<p>
You&#39;ve heard enough, and want to know what you&#39;ll really be doing on the job as a Climatologist? Read on!
</p>
<p>
	Depending on your specific position, you may end up either running computer models in your office, or conducting research from the ground or aircraft. 
</p>
<p>
	<em>Entry-level:</em>Many climatologists in the Federal Government start with an intern position where they may do routine data aggregation, calculations, analysis, or simple forecasting for training and experience. “Entry-level” at a university essentially entails being a teaching assistant for research professors, or assisting with their climate research. At a private consulting firm you’ll often start as an intern, and upon receiving a full-time offer you’ll work on individual accounts. 
</p>
<p>
	<em>Mid-level:</em> The path diverges as you gain experience in your specialty. Working for the Federal Government you may be assigned to a permanent station or be a part of a research and development team influencing federal policy decisions. At a consulting firm you may manage individual accounts or more junior consultants. At a corporation you may advance to a senior position.
</p>
<p>
<em>Top-level:</em> Experienced climatologists can advance to managerial or supervisory positions with more administrative tasks, or lead the research in a certain topic. The field is rapidly changing though, and the opportunities for you at this level of expertise are limitless.
