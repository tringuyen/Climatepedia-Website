<p>Climategate is the term dubbed by the media to a controversy in which unidentified persons illegally published material they obtained from a Climate Research Unit online. Some observers declared the emails revealed misconduct within the CRU and climate science community as a whole, but three separate investigations later concluded that there was no evidence of scientific malpractice. </p>

</div>

<a name="what"></a>
<h4>What Happened?</h4>
<p>It began in mid-November 2009 when a server belonging to the University of East Anglia&#39;s (UAE) Climatic Research Unit (CRU) was accessed, and more than 1,000 emails and 3,000 other documents were stolen and leaked to the internet. A UEA spokeswoman confirmed that the information was not on a server that could be easily accessed and therefore could not have been unintentionally released (1). Allegations were made that climate scientists had manipulated or deleted data in order to support evidence of global warming, and much of the controversy centered on a small number of emails involving Phil Jones, the Director of CRU. </p>

<p>The alarm arose from the fact that the authors of the documents were some of the most important climate scientists behind the claims that man-made emissions were causing global warming (Anthropogenic Global Warming), some playing a role in the UN&#39;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Professor Philip Jones was responsible for key sets of data used by the IPCC in its reports. During the reviews of the CRU Jones temporarily stood down from his post, and has since been reinstated as Director of Research after he was cleared of the most severe allegations.</p>
<p>Three investigations into the matter rejected these accusations, concluding that there was no evidence of scientific malpractice.</p>

<a name="first"></a>
<h4>First Investigation</h4>
<p>The first reported on 31 March 2010 and found that &quot;the scientific reputation of Professor Jones and CRU remains intact.&quot; It focused on the following&#58;</p>

<ul>

<li>The accuracy and availability of CRU&#39;s data</li>

<li>Allowing access to the data and methodology under the Freedom of Information Act</li>

</ul>

<h6>Their conclusions were as follows&#58;</h6>

<a name="conclusion1"></a>
<p class="quote"><em>136. Conclusion 1&#58;</em> The focus on Professor Jones and CRU has been largely misplaced. On the accusations relating to Professor Jones&#39;s refusal to share raw data and computer codes, we consider that his actions were in line with common practice in the climate science community. We have suggested that the community consider becoming more transparent by publishing raw data and detailed methodologies. On accusations relating to Freedom of Information, we consider that much of the responsibility should lie with UEA, not CRU.</p>
<a name="conclusion2"></a>
<p class="quote"><em>137. Conclusion 2&#58;</em> In addition, insofar as we have been able to consider accusations of dishonesty&#45; for example, Professor Jones&#39;s alleged attempt to "hide the decline"â€”we consider that there is no case to answer. Within our limited inquiry and the evidence we took, the scientific reputation of Professor Jones and CRU remains intact. We have found no reason in this unfortunate episode to challenge the scientific consensus as expressed by Professor Beddington, that "global warming is happening [and] that it is induced by human activity".[184] It was not our purpose to examine, nor did we seek evidence on, the science produced by CRU. It will be for the Scientific Appraisal Panel to look in detail into all the evidence to determine whether or not the consensus view remains valid.</p> 
<a name="conclusion3"></a>
<p class="quote"><em>138. Conclusion 3&#58;</em> A great responsibility rests on the shoulders of climate science&#58; to provide the planet&#39;s decision makers with the knowledge they need to secure our future. The challenge that this poses is extensive and some of these decisions risk our standard of living. When the prices to pay are so large, the knowledge on which these kinds of decisions are taken had better be right. The science must be irreproachable.</p>

<p>A little humor is healthy, but ultimately the investigations concluded that there was no scientific scandal.</p>

<a name="second"></a>
<h4>Second Investigation</h4>
<p>The second investigation was conducted by an independent Science Assessment Panel, and was published on 14 April 2010. The panel was set up by the University of East Anglia in order to &#34;assess the integrity of the research published by the Climatic Research Unit in the light of various external assertions.&#34; Their investigation focused on review of 11 works published by the CRU and evaluation of the integrity of the Unit&#39;s research rather than its correctness. In their report&#39;s conclusion regarding scientific malpractice they stated the following&#58;</p>

<p class="quote">1. We saw no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice in any of the work
of the Climatic Research Unit and had it been there we believe that it is likely
that we would have detected it. Rather we found a small group of dedicated if
slightly disorganised researchers who were ill-prepared for being the focus of
public attention. As with many small research groups their internal procedures were rather informal.</p>

<p>They also commented that they were surprised by the fact that &#34;research in an area that
depends so heavily on statistical methods has not been carried out in close
collaboration with professional statisticians...&#34; and that collaboration between the CRU and a broader scientific community outside of their temperature specialty would be mutually beneficial.</p>

<a name="third"></a>
<h4>Third Investigation</h4>
<p>The third investigation was conducted by the Independent Climate Change Email Review, which was funded by the University of East Anglia but was completely independent. In contrast to the previous investigation, this one focused on the hacked email exchanges and other such information to &#34;determine whether there is any evidence of manipulation or suppression of data which is at odds with acceptable scientific practice.&#34; The final report was published on July 7, 2010. In their findings, the Review stated the following&#58;</p>

<p class="quote">13. Climate science is a matter of such global importance, that the highest standards
of honesty, rigour and openness are needed in its conduct. On the specific
allegations made against the behaviour of CRU scientists, <em>we find that their
rigour and honesty as scientists are not in doubt.</em></p>

<p class="quote">14. In addition, we do not find that their behaviour has prejudiced the balance of
advice given to policy makers. In particular, <em>we did not find any evidence of
behaviour that might undermine the conclusions of the IPCC assessments.</em></p>

<p class="quote">15. <em>But we do find that there has been a consistent pattern of failing to display
the proper degree of openness</em>, both on the part of the CRU scientists and on the
part of the UEA, who failed to recognise not only the significance of statutory
requirements but also the risk to the reputation of the University and, indeed, to
the credibility of UK climate science.</p>
